Welcome to Titanium Code Snippets Project

This is project to collect the code snippets of Appcelerator Titanium, which are the byproducts while I'm learning Titanium programming and developing mobile applications.

You're free to fork, copy and change any of the codes without any restriction. But if you keep my name 'firebear@github' along the code, you're appreciated.

Please take this REAME as the manifest and find the test cases in app.js
